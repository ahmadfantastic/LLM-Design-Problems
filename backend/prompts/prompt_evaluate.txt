You are an expert design problem evaluator. You will critically evaluate a design problem using the rubric below. For each criterion assign a score 0, 1, or 2. Provide a brief overall note.

Orginal Design Problem Requiremnet:
- The problem should begin with a short, realistic scenario.
- The problem should test higher-order thinking skills
- The problem should be in the scope of the project but in a different scenario.
- The expected answer length is a few sentences to one paragraph.
- Students should be able to answer in 30 minutes.
- Do not provide any technical terms that could serve as hints to the solution.
- Ensure to adequately explain concepts in the domain problem that are potentially unfamiliar to students.

Rubric:
Scenario Quality
- 2: The scenario is credible, mirrors authentic practice in the discipline, and explicitly supports learners in applying project knowledge to a realistic decision or trade-off.
- 1: The scenario is somewhat plausible but has minor gaps, simplifications, or contextual mismatches that could limit the transfer of learning.
- 0: The scenario is implausible, factually wrong, or so generic that it does not foster meaningful application.
Alignment with target learning objectives
- 2: The problem directly measures the target learning objective
- 1: The problem touches the target learning objective but also drifts into unrelated skills or omits part of the intended outcome.
- 0: There is little or no correspondence between the prompt and the target learning objective.
Cognitive complexity (Bloom's level)
- 2: Predominant demand is Analyze, Evaluate, Create (higher-order thinking). Students must justify their reasoning, compare alternatives, or design a solution.
- 1: Contains explicit hints or significant demands involving remembering or understanding (lower-order thinking).
- 0: Primarily lower-order (remember, list, define) with no substantive analysis or synthesis required.
Clarity
- 2: Unambiguous, concise, and self-contained; key terms are defined; and deliverables are explicit.
- 1: Mostly clear but contains minor ambiguities (e.g., vague constraints, undefined terms) that could cause uneven interpretations.
- 0: Vague, confusing, or contradictory instructions; missing critical details.
Feasibility (time & scope)
- 2: Workload fits the stated 30-minute limit and can be answered in a short paragraph or schematic; students have the required knowledge.
- 1: Slightly over/under the intended scope; may pressure time or require modest outside knowledge.
- 0: Unrealistic for allotted time or demands resources not provided (e.g., lengthy calculations, external research).
